<h2>artist prompts ...</h2>

<p>In my practice, I aim to create intuitively. My most ephemeral works are reaction based rather than preconcieved ideas ready to be executed. I am most intrigued by infusing as much detail and intention into transmogrification between digital and analogue techniques to create a work. In VISCOM I’ve found that this method of creating is much harder due to project guides, proposals, and limited time.  

    Over the semester I’ve been trying to work the “off the dome” approach into the VISCOM way. My current multimedia piece utilizes assemblage, screen printing, and will soon induce collaged, hand set, typography to sit on top of screen print. I believe that every artist carries some anxiety at a point in their career, wether thats self or external judgment, success, if their practice is “enough” etc.  I struggle the most through working out an idea from nothing and this appears the most in my painting practice. I have very few works left unfinished, however, when they do go unfinished it’s because I wasn’t talented enough to execute, I lost interest, or the idea had no potential. The validation sought out when a piece is finished seems essential to the overall “completion” of it. I feel like a lot of people at this institution and beyond find themselves finishing a piece and immediately reaching to show a friend. I am guilty of this, additionally I continue to find myself asking others for critique and mostly unable to judge my own work as it nears the ending stages.  Besides my lack of ability to conceptualize type, this is one of the biggest holes in my practice. When the piece is finished,  I feel very satisfied and am excited to show my friends what I’ve made. I also consider if the connect or result is strong enough to continue transforming it. All of the work I’ve done in the past 3 months has multiple mediums and techniques in it. I think some of the processes I’ve used are a bit heavy handed, but my processes refine themselves the more I create. </p>


<h3> Artist Statement</h3>

<p>As an artist, my curiosity drives me to explore the transmogrification of digital and analog techniques, blending them with purpose and careful attention to detail. My work is often sparked by my perception of sound, information, or personal experiences, and my goal is to capture the feelings that each of these sources evoke. Whether it’s a moment I’m processing or an abstract concept, I aim to translate that emotion into visual form.

  I work at the crossroads of fine arts and graphic design, constantly seeking ways to merge these disciplines. This ongoing exploration of how digital and analog processes can coexist in a single piece gives my work a unique authenticity. The combination of multimedia techniques adds layers of complexity that cannot be achieved by focusing on just one medium. Each piece is an expression of this fusion, with the different methods contributing to an overall texture and depth that feels organic and true to the subject. It’s this blending of processes that makes my work distinctive—each piece is a product of both the creative process and the emotions I seek to convey.</p>
